# Machine Learning

## Overview
This folder <b>showcases</b> a comprehensive approach to predictive modeling using <b>machine learning techniques</b>. The primary goal is to <b>develop robust models throught three practical cases studies</b> that not only provide accurate predictions but also offer actionable insights.

## Projects

### Supervised Machine Learning
- [Conversion Rate Challenges](conversion-rate/README.md)
- [Walmart Sales](walmart-sales/README.md)

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
- [Uber pickups](uber-pickups/README.md)

## Key Objectives 
### Effective Predictive Analysis 

- <b>Algorithm Choice:</b> Selecting appropriate ML techniques (supervised/unsupervised).
- <b>Data Pipeline Design:</b> Streamlining data preparation for optimal model training.
- <b>Clustering Optimization:</b> Implementing methods to choose K or Epsilon effectively.
- <b>Code Cleanliness:</b> Ensuring PEP8 compliance in Python codebases.
- <b>Performance Measurement:</b> Using metrics like RÂ², F1-Score, and cross-validation.  

### Optimized Machine Learning Performance 

- <b>Evaluation Criteria:</b> Choosing the right metrics based on problem type.
- <b>Model Improvement:</b> Demonstrating enhanced performance over previous models.   

### Accurate Predictions & Recommendations 

- Ensuring predictions are reliable and recommendations are actionable.
