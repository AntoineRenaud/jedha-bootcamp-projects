# Machine Learning Projects

## Overview
This folder <b>showcases</b> a comprehensive approach to predictive modeling using <b>machine learning techniques</b>. The primary goal is to <b>develop robust models throught three practical cases studies</b> that not only provide accurate predictions but also offer actionable insights.

## Projects

### Supervised Machine Learning
- [Conversion Rate Challenges](conversion-rate/README.md)
- [Walmart Sales](walmart-sales/README.md)

### Unsupervised Machine Learning
- [Uber pickups](uber-pickups/README.md)

## Key Objectives 
### Effective Predictive Analysis 

- **Algorithm Choice:** Selecting appropriate ML techniques (supervised/unsupervised).
- **Data Pipeline Design:** Streamlining data preparation for optimal model training.
- **Clustering Optimization:** Implementing methods to choose K or Epsilon effectively.
- **Code Cleanliness:** Ensuring PEP8 compliance in Python codebases.
- **Performance Measurement:** Using metrics like RÂ², F1-Score, and cross-validation.  

### Optimized Machine Learning Performance 

- **Evaluation Criteria:** Choosing the right metrics based on problem type.
- **Model Improvement:** Demonstrating enhanced performance over previous models.   

### Accurate Predictions & Recommendations 

- Ensuring predictions are reliable and recommendations are actionable.
