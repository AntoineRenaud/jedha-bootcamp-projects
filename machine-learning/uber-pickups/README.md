### Project Overview

This project focuses on identifying "hot-zones" in New York City where Uber drivers should position themselves to reduce passenger wait times. By analyzing Uber pickup data, we aim to create algorithms that recommend optimal locations for drivers at any given time of day.

### Dataset

We will use Uber trip data specific to New York City. The dataset can be found here:

### Objectives

Algorithm Development: Create algorithms to find hot-zones using clustering techniques.
Visualization: Display the results on a map using Python libraries like Plotly.
Temporal Analysis: Describe hot-zones per day of the week.
Algorithm Comparison: Compare results using at least two unsupervised algorithms (e.g., KMeans and DBSCAN).

### Deliverables

A map showcasing hot-zones using any Python library.
Analysis of hot-zones for each day of the week.
A comparison report between at least two clustering algorithms.

### Helpers

Clustering is Your Friend: Use clustering techniques to group pickup locations and identify hot-zones.
Mapping Tools: Utilize Plotly or similar libraries to create interactive maps.
Start Small, Grow Big: Begin with data from a specific day and hour, then generalize your approach to include more time periods.
