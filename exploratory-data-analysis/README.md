# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains two case studies focused on exploratory data analysis:
 - [Tinder's speed dating survey](speed-dating/README.md)
 - [Steam's videogame marketplace](steam-platform/README.md)

The objective is to explore a dataset and determine its ability to answer a predefined problem statement.

## Key Aspects of the Analysis

### Data Selection and Cleaning
- Assessment of dataset relevance to the problem statement.
- Application of data cleaning methodologies, including handling missing or inconsistent values.
- Evaluation of data clarity and availability for analysis.

### Analytical Approach
- Univariate analyses, including means and variances.
- Anomaly detection using distribution analysis.
- Correlation analysis using Pearson Matrix.
- Effectiveness and efficiency of the parallelized processing applied.

### Insights and Recommendations
- Interpretation of analysis results to derive meaningful recommendations.
- Clear and simple visualization of findings through graphs.
- Well-structured and comprehensible presentation of results.

## Repository Structure
- `src/` - Contains the datasets used for analysis.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks with the EDA process and findings.
