## Project Overview

This project explores the factors influencing mutual interest during speed dating, using data from experimental events conducted by Tinder's marketing team. The goal is to analyze what drives people to agree to a second date.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information from speed dating events between 2002-2004, including participant ratings on attributes like Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, and Shared Interests, as well as demographic and lifestyle data.

## Objectives

Use descriptive statistics and visualizations to explore:
- Key factors driving mutual interest.
- Differences in mate selection preferences between genders.
- How perceived vs. real attributes influence second date decisions.

## Key Questions

What attributes are least desirable in a partner?
Is attractiveness more important than shared interests?
How accurately do people predict their perceived value?

## Deliverables

You will find a Jupyter notebook containing:
    Descriptive statistics
    Visualizations
    Interpretations explaining the relevance of the findings to second date decisions.
